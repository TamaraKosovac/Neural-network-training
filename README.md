# NeuralNetworkTraining
## Description
University project in the form of a console application implemented in Python. A neural network was trained on the Covertype dataset using an arbitrary architecture, paying attention to the appropriate number of input and output neurons. An adequate error function was used, and the network was trained for a certain number of epochs with a defined batch size. Accuracy and response on the test data set before and after training were calculated. The validation set is defined, and early stopping is implemented, which stops the training if the error on the validation set increases during three consecutive epochs, with a tolerance of two epochs of error growth.
The hyperparameter space was searched by varying the initial learning factor and two additional network architecture parameters. The model with the best accuracy on the validation set was identified.
